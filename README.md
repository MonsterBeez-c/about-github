A repo for messing around with GitHub

GitHub can do lots of things. This repo is for me to do some or those things.

# Kanban board
Click "Projects" up the top of this page

# Milestones
Click "Issues" then "Milestones"

# Wiki
You guesssed it, click "Wiki" up the top

# User Voice
You can create a tag for feature requests. Describe the feature request, add an up and a down thumb. Then, with a link to your issues with the "Feature Request" label, you've got a feature voting system: https://github.com/davidgilbertson/about-github/labels/Feature%20Request. I stole this idea wholesale from https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fscrimba%2Fcommunity%2Fissues%3Fq%3Dis%253Aopen%2Bis%253Aissue%2Blabel%253Afeature-request%2Bsort%253Areactions-%252B1-desc
